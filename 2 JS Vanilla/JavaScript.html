                <ul>
                    <li>as in css , u can include ur code to the HTML file with3 ways inline script-tag or in-head
                        script-tag or in separate file , when u use file ALWAYS PUT THE SCRIPT.src TAG MANUALLY B4 BODY
                        CLOSE specially if it interact with html elements so the browser load it after the HTML elements
                        are loaded, <br>
                        in js when a though/definition/loop/func is finished Semicolon is expected , if its not there
                        u can see in vs-code on the navigation-bar even if u go lines below that u still in the same
                        though and not returned to empty space for new though. <br>
                        every thing defined in the js file is added to a large obj that include all called window(with
                        small w) that already come with the js built-in methods like alret and objects like math .

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="ST">primitives :</span> (in other langs: types)</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Numbers: in VJS there is one type of numbers (no float or integer) , <br>
                                mathmatical operators: +-*/ are built in in addition %(mod) **(rais pow): <br>
                                operation and they behave as math order of operations (* 1st b4 +-) , mod (% operator
                                gives the remaining) and through it js decide if no. is even(/2 %=0) or odd(/2 %=1) , **
                                mean rais to some power 2**3=8 , js can store up to 16no. after decimal point then it
                                will round up <br>
                            <li>NaN : this primitive type is number! and it mean that the outcome is meaningless like
                                0/0 or if any variable got NaN as value involved in other operation result will be NaN
                            </li>

                            <li>Variables(identifier): (name of the value) store values for further use/change , when u
                                define it use let like let MyYear=2000 ,its look like the name of val just when its
                                defined but when the named used l8er it means put the val of this name here, so in case
                                u wna update var inc/depending on previous value u define it again and inside use the
                                var-name as value:
                                <code class="language-js">let MyCount = MyCount - 3 or MyCount-=3 ++</code>
                                ,each ration/func must have var to store in it . <br>
                                const : to define variable that wouldnt be changed <br>
                                var : is the old way of let , so dont use it! . <br>
                                in VJS variable type can be changed on redefine, also note that var keyword is existed
                                and the diffirance from let is that it can be read from any scope/block , we use let to
                                avoide multi-scope-defines issues .
                                it is better when define empty varz to assign it to = undefined <br>
                                declaration mean u mention an identifier but not necessary have brrn initialized with a
                                value or expression(like funcs and class).
                            </li>
                            <li>Boolean : true/false usually identifier start with isXYZ (isLogedIn) to remind yes/no
                                questions . <br>
                                every value in js is true except : false , 0 , ``(empty string) , null ,
                                undefined , NaN . </li>

                            <li>String : most be wraped with ` ` or ' ' or " " (try to use backtick instead of quotes )
                                specially when u add quote in the string then start wrap it with '' , every letter is
                                indexed starting from 0 (as array[index]) inc the spaces , when u add 2 str1+str2
                                the result is combined srt with no space (it rather be added), <br>
                                building/concate string with js with the old way called concatenation ("you bought "+
                                qty + " "+ "products") , the new way called <strong>Template Literals</strong> and it
                                works only with backticks and it uses $ (means theContentOf as on most cases) e.g
                                concatenation: <br>
                                <code class="language-js">
                                    `you bought ` + qty + ` ` + product + `. Total is: ` + price * qty

                                because the executed moves to next condetion when the previous is false u can make
                                gradiual ranges checking using else-if . else alone is to cover all other cases. <br>
                                an old way to write it with ; according to online editor <code class="language-js">if(myVar==`go`){console.log('go');}else
                                    {console.log('purple');}</code><br>
                                nesting : if u wna use more than condition each one have its own false outcome but they
                                have one true outcome when all of them must be true : u can nest them one inside the
                                other and they dont have true outcome except the deepest it will get the one common true
                                outcome for all . <br>
                                when condition made for part of a range that covered by another condition , the one that
                                take place is the condition that written 1st , not the one that cover smaller (specific)
                                part !!! . <br>
                                else-if used to start/test new cond with its own else , but without adding else nad
                                making the new cond !1st cond it will be equal to else (instead of else if)
                            </li>

                            <li>Switch statment : fancy way to write "else if" it uses when specific conditions needed
                                to be checked and they cant be covered/grouped by ranges (except !var), note that the
                                word break if not added it will execute every func come after the true condition with
                                checking ther conditin , this can be used if u wana more than one func be activated when
                                one condition is true or u can write 2+ cases one after another to give them same func ,
                                the default is what funs to do if all of the conditions are false , and it can be just
                                break.
                            </li>

                            <li> on condetions u can use identifier alone without assign on what value and it will
                                mean if it true (defined with true value) , then if u used !var it will mean if the var
                                have false value to cover the js false values .
                            </li>
                            <li>acording to w3schools: "The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all
                                JavaScript comparisons and conditions" <br>
                                dont confuse true var with true conditionone , one sided condetion (without ==) is
                                always check if true,if (!myVar) means if the opposite the Boolean value of myVar is tru
                                (means if its false) </li>

                                        with this . if think about it its like specefic args that not passed in the ()

                        <ul>
                            <li>for loop : consist of start point end point(as cond.) and steps size(incrementEx) ,
                                note that in this loop u have declared a var to use as counter so no need for out side
                                one , and if u start counting from 0 ur end point Ex should be
                                <span><code class="language-js"> i&lt;arr.length or i&lt;=arr.length -1 </code></span>
                                (like last i in arr) , usually u can cuz infinite loop when the stop
                                point is not in the counting/stepping diriction , vs-code template have const
                                element=arr[i] so u can apply methods and funcs on elemnt , always remember when an
                                input is choosing value from arr it will be at [input-1] , like if user choose 1st thing
                                ita at [0]!!!!! <br>
                            </li>
                            <li>nesting loops : when u have 2 nested 1st one have 6 iterations and inside it one with 7
                                iterations then for each one of the 1st loop iterationsthere will be 7
                                iterations(results), its like for each value u generate on 1st loop u include/applyOn it
                                at 7 iterations on the second loop , usually the 1st one is preparing
                                ordering/indixing/formation for the second .
                                <br>
                                an example for that is dealing with nested arrays : u have to make inside the 1st loop
                                new var that in each parent loop step its value is one of the child arrays parentArr[i]
                                then the second loop will full no. of iterations on each arr that saved in var at the
                                time.
                                <br>
                                in loop if u choose to define i as loop inner var then remember the diffirance between
                                ${i}(the incremented no. ) and ${arr[i]}(the actual value) , and when u wna print the
                                index of value remember to add 1 on the concat so u start from 1 .
                            </li>
                            <li>while loop :this loop mostly used with user input/prompt rather than arrs/objs (but
                                could be used) if for-loop means apply this funs on next [ith] , while means : while
                                this condition is true execute these funcs then CHECK THE CONDITION AGAIN!!!! , just
                                when its not true u can execute the rest of the code bcz of that its usually used with
                                stand alone functionality like prompt , be used as for-loop just the 3 elements of start
                                end increment are divided for 2 main cases :
                                <ol>
                                    <li>using pre-defined var :in order to use already defined var in the Window that we
                                        need to use as start point, then on the while statment we define the
                                        condetion(end) and inside we define the increment and watch out for its
                                        position:usually its at the end so the funcs could be applied on the 1st i .
                                    </li>
                                    <li>user input(no increment): before write this while-loop u need 1st to prompt the
                                        user(saved to var) , then if the var not as condition(false) func is same var
                                        with prompt until wanted result is obtained , then after the loop a func that u
                                        wna execute after success . with other functionality than prompt u need to be
                                        sure that is have hold(?!) otherwise it will turn into infinite loop. <br>
                                        u can make the prompt using if-func-break;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>double condetion and break; : double condetion used (mostly) when 1st one is a
                                        boolean condetion to start this loop (otherwise wouldnt execute) then the func
                                        that gonna be repeated then the change and the 2nd cond is the if statment that
                                        contain cond with break; , here u can see thats its like Switch-case the
                                        diffirance is that its start again as long as the 1st cond is true and 2nd if
                                        false</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>for-of : its english-like shortcut of classic for-loop with +=1 only ! , for(const
                                newVar of myArr){}; u can use it also on nested arrz
                            </li>
                            <li>iteration over obj : obj are not likly to get iterated on , there is a loob called
                                for-in but its iterate over the obj names(keys)only but not commonly used , so more
                                convenient way is to extract names and valz to arrz with methods Object.values(myObj)
                                and Object.keys(myObj) and Object.entries(myObj) that return arr of arrz in each there
                                is the name and val then use double nested for-of, func that take obj names and values
                                to change them and put results into new obj (cuz objs is const cuz got ref) </li>

                        <p><span class="ST">Functions : </span></p> functions have identifier name to use l8er like
                        anyother one which defined earlier to use l8er , in js (unlike other langz) u can use the func
                        b4 definition .
                        <br>
                        funcs can be build with parameters (that gonna be replaced l8er with arguments) or without
                        params , also the params can be a must or optional depends on how the func uses them , usually
                        the optional are the latest ones so the params order matters .
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                function decleration (define) syntax :
                                <code class="language-js">function name([param[, param[, ...
                                    param]]]){statements}</code><br>
                                param is the name (placeholder) for an argument to be passed to the function.
                            </li>
                            <li>return key word : (the func statment to the outer scope)used when the output value of
                                func/method expected to be saved to identifier or the in method case followed by dot
                                (obj.method.somMthd) to do somthing with that return Immediately without save in var
                                , without that funcs will make changes when they invoked but the val will stay without
                                use,saving to identifier is done WHEN THE FUNC INVOKED NOT WHEN DEFINED!!! , also
                                note that return end the func any thing after it wouldnt be executed , in
                                case of cond u can use return for if and return for func :when if-cond is true
                                its return will be exuted and cancel every thing after it !!! </li>
                            <li>when u use a func with a loop that need a var to be changes saver like total , it should
                                be declared inside the func and returned in the bottom of the func </li>
                            <li>if identifier defined b4 func and changed in it the change can be seen AFTER FUNC
                                invoked
                            </li>
                            <li>scope types : global.scp / func.scp / block.scp / lexical.scp(nested inner can see outer
                                bc to global) </li>
                            <li>if identifier is redefined inside func scope the original will be changed just if u
                                returned it and its not const , if no return then it will be just internal for the func
                            </li>

                            <li>Function Expression/pattern : 1st pattern was the normal define with func name , now 2nd
                                is Anonymous Function which have 2 types of Expression :
                                <ol>
                                    <li>1st Anonymous : is define func inside var without func name ,invoked via var() ,
                                        but now it can passed to func/obj/arr, or returned/pulled inside var. (l8er
                                        also arrow func)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>arrow funcz : ()=>{}; make sure u have ; on end of last code b4 it , its
                                        compact/shortcut for anonymous fucz , usually use inside methods and events but
                                        on normal js window flow u have to give it a name; if it have 1 arg u can wright
                                        it without the () , u can even eliminate thereturn keyword if ur func start with
                                        return by replace {} with () and if this whole func is chained in one line (no
                                        line break) u can also eliminate the () like :
                                        <span><code class="language-js"> (a,b) => a*b </code></span>
                                        &nbsp; or &nbsp;
                                        <span><code class="language-js"> a => a*2 </code></span> <br>
                                        arrow-func/js-methods and this:(vid 230) arrow-func cant see any scope back to
                                        the window obj unless there is a function keyword on the way then this-k inside
                                        the arrow will refere to the obj which function found in. its not the scope that
                                        stop it from reaching the obj (e.g nested objz), so if its inside an obj method
                                        like setTimeout (which naturaly inside func) at 4:35 it will not read the window
                                        obj cuz no function word in the middle but there is one between it and person
                                        obj then it will read it , and thus when anonymous is used like at 4:05 it does
                                        read the window-obj of setTimeout. in short u wouldnt use arrow to define a
                                        method , just when it alrdy inside an anonymous func.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (iife): that executes a function instantly
                                after it's defined to ensure variables are only accessible within the scope of the
                                defined function.the expression looks like : <code class="language-js"> (function
                                    myFunc() {})();</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>Callback function : is passed into another function as an argument, which is then
                                invoked inside the outer/primary function to complete a routine/action.
                            </li>
                            <li>high order function : its a func that include/accept/return funcs , now merging this
                                with anonymous fucs give us nice automation for executing l8 the func name but the
                                actual func is depending on high order func return and that could be depending on what
                                had as arg func (the last exe line is blind exe), func return hard coded func is high
                                order but one that build func according to argz called factory function ( like 1st lvl
                                of argz to build a func that exe on 2nd lvl of argz !!) </li>
                            <li>obj methods : same logic of anonymous just the func is a val of a name inside obj and it
                                called as obj.name() </li>
                            <li>try{}-catch()-finally(): error is expected out of some func , u but it in try-catch
                                (like cond for funcs) that if the no err is back the code work fine but if there is a
                                err the catch swill replace the try on the execution flow so the flow dont stop, on the
                                catch usually its catch(anyParam){console.log(anyParam)} which will replace the red js
                                err + alternative func to execute include msg to user, if u wna print the err use
                                (anyArg)on catch to resample the err-msg . <br> [from future]: this catch and finally
                                are the same as followed after promise so if there is a pre-built func that emit err
                                catch will auto take it as arg so when u see on console " Uncaught error " it mean u
                                havent prepare a catch for it !
                                <br>
                            </li>
                            <li>setTimeout : activate this func after this time , setTimeout(()=>{},3000) </li>
                            <li>setInterval : same patern as setTimeout wich but must be saved into a const-varin order
                                to use clearInterval(var) ,this will repeat on the fixed time, 2 ways of syntax :
                                <code class="language-js"> setInterval(()=>{div1.innerHTML+="Hello"},3000);</code><br>
                                the recursive pattern : <br>
                                <code class="language-js">(function loop(){setTimeout(()=>{div1.innerText +=
                                    `Hello`;loop();}, 1100);})();</code>

                        <p><span class="ST">New Features to JS : </span></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>JavaScript Hoisting : (not new but here the place for it) Hoisting is JavaScript's
                                default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top
                                of the current script or the current function).means variable that declared with let and
                                const (NOT FUNCZ!!) can be initialized with val and used before it has been declared !!
                                (ofc declaration and initializations must be on same scope{lvl}) . therefore please note
                                : JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. <br>
                                this feature one used in the old langz to make code more readable and not desturbed for
                                person who read with declarations (make it more eng) but always declare variables at
                                the beginning of every scope, and JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to
                                be used if they are not declared. </li>
                            <li>default params : when u put params in parentheses on define u can put (x,y,z=10) which
                                mean if notheng passed on that arg the no.10 will be passed by default that way u dont
                                need to add cond what to do on if undefined , on multi params put thee one with default
                                l8 and the ones without defaul on start so if there is a lack in params no the not
                                protected will get one and others will use default so the func still work and err seen
                                on screen instead of console . </li>
                            <li>Spread : used in fucs args,array literal,obj literal <ul>
                                    <li>spread in func/mthd(...iterable) /,this is especially for fuc/mthd that expect
                                        one value on each param ,like if u give it arrName its not a single val that can
                                        work on ,so this one do expand/spread the arr INDEXES inside the parentheses, in
                                        deap think
                                        this is iteration the take every index and put it as argument .</li>
                                    <li>spread arr in array literal: let myArr = [a,b,...anArr,"rt"] , also if it used
                                        with sting it will add one char at a time </li>
                                    <li>spread in obj literal : here its spread the names and value , if 2 objz are
                                        spreaded sand they have common name the 2nd one is rewrite the val , if arr
                                        spreaded in obj it will be index as name + valz </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Rest : it look like spread(...) but used on in args at funcz-define (spread used on func
                                invoke) , and what it do is collect the args from its position onward (A rest parameter
                                must be last in a parameter list), and but them into an arr for in-func use . note that
                                this is not workong incide arrow funcs. its also can be sused on destructuring
                                (basically its used in args(arr-like) and destructuring arr) </li>

                                                u can do : let newArr=myArr.filter(({score})={score>=90};)

                    <ul>
                        <li>what is DOM : <br>
                            Dom is a model (api) for the document-object wich ultimately connects web pages
                            (html) to programming languages to represent the structure of a document—like page
                            in memory (to somthing executable). Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though
                            modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript
                            language. like to say if we have H1 on the html page then on the DOM will get a JS object
                            that modeling (represent) that H1 .
                            <br>
                            The DOM model represented as logical tree where connections; objz are related as
                            perents and children . Each branch of the tree ends in a nodes, and
                            each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With
                            them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.Nodes can also have
                            event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get
                            executed.
                            DOM (document object model) : is a common model(object/API!) for all browsers
                            regarding how to represent the html on the page (instructions/data for displaying),we have 2
                            problems :
                            <ol>
                                <li>html is just static markup lang but not programming lang , so we need js as
                                    programming lang to cond/change things .</li>
                                <li>html and js are not the same lang so we need an api to connect them so the
                                    js can control the markups which is the DOM.</li>
                            </ol>
                            now the DOM is the obj that have all the info as objz for each data structure
                            and its auto created for each web page (html). in DOM for every html elements
                            there is pre-defined js obj and the attributes actually are the obj-names , in fact
                            u can build html document using js only , sure it will be much longer work.
                            from here u can imagine what it is : every element have entire object which its
                            properties are the attributes , one of them is style ! , on vs-code all these auto
                            complete intellisense at html are actually the pre-defined objects names .
                            <br>
                            then ,on the higher lvl of manipulation that we make with js by using the window-obj
                            methods(the browser tab lvl), these are the most api-sh thing (DOM is html to js api
                            ,this is js to browser-inner-lang api) bcz the definition of methods like
                            onScroll/onLoad/onKeyPress is found on the browser engine-side that cant be changed
                            (unlike the DOM values) we use it as event(cond) to execute funcs when it fired .
                            <br>
                            in terms of front end this is the higher on the tree(the deeper/closer to system
                            resources) that we can get as web developers from here each browser have its own way
                            of implementation on the otherside , that what make the difference in performace and
                            compatibility but that not our concern as web dev .
                            <br>
                            note that after user interaction happen the results can be displayed but on
                            refreshing the page they will disappeare , from here the next lvl is to save the changes on
                            local-storage/server-side and load it on next page load / refresh .
                            <br>
                            this image recapping the lvlz : <br><br>

                            in console if u look for document or id of html element u will get tags but if u
                            type the command: console.dir(document) or saved to var : myVar =
                            document.getElementById(`ThisId`) then console.dir(myVar) it will print the DOM
                            version of the selected id . <br>
                            while we start to talk about js things , remember to include the js script tag at b4

                        <li>DOM selecting elements methods :
                            <ul>
                                <li>document.getElementById(`ThisId`) can be saved to var for further use as
                                    myVar.innerHTML or Immediately as (`ThisId`).innerHTML </li>
                                <li>document.getElementsssByTagName(`ThisTag`) : this return an HTML collection
                                    (which is NOT array) of all this tags </li>
                                <li>HTML Collection its a list of Elements , can use .length and the iterable (can
                                    use for-of) , not when u save one to var by id that not exist on page the var
                                    will be null,but from tag or class it will be empty shell of collection </li>
                                <li>document.getElementsssByClass Name(`ThisClass`) : same idea like tagName make
                                    collection from class of urs or bootstrap </li>
                                <li><i>document.querySelector/querySelectorAll(`elm` `#id` `.class`
                                        `x[Attr="val"]`):</i>
                                    this is a new addition to the DOM and it use all css Selectors and Combinators
                                    for addressing elements, without all it return the 1st match </li>
                                <li>remember attributes actually are properties in the element obj so when u iterate
                                    over HTML collection u can use el.href el.src el.title </li>
                                <li>all of these selecting methods could be used to extract and save to var or to
                                    change properties in the element obj as we will see next up .</li>

                                    there is a method to check if class-atr contain some class :
                                    elVar.<i>classList.contain</i>(``)it return T/F . <br>
                                    another method is elVar.<i>classList.toggle</i>(``) each time invoked it
                                    flip T/F status , usually used onClick

                        executing code as response to user interaction with parts of the page . the base
                        principle is that the browser is monitoring ur input hardware and listen for them all the time
                        (as any input-depending software) ,so we gonna do some funcs after having an evt or evt.prop is
                        true the use of this is when <br>
                        each event can be added in 3 ways :
                        <ol>
                            <li>in-line as attribute inside HTML tag : button <i>onclick=</i>"(alert(``);)"> ,
                                note that sif u use same kind of quotes u for attr and string u will get err and if
                                there is </li>
                            <li>set that event property after elVart : elVar.theEvent = function(){}; , note
                                that its= func(){} not ev(func) or ev=func() and here u can know in js file you MUStNT
                                INVOKE inside event cuz it will be executed on page loading , while u can do that on
                                elm tag in HTML , this way u can do elVar with querySelectorAll(.thisClass) to
                                make same event for all . for these 2 ways of adding event use this list of <a
                                    target="_blank" href="events.html">events</a></li>
                            <li>elVar.<i>addEventListener(`event`, func/funcVar(callback),{how})</i> : NO INVOKE
                                , it use the event name without "on" ,and if u add predefined func add the name without
                                parenthese so it wouldnt be exuted Immediately, also it can be add how to do it like
                                {once:true}
                            </li>
                            ** the difference between 1st and 2nd way is that if u used elVar.event again it
                            will overwrite the prop-val , but with addEventListener 2nd one will be add to the
                            previous valz
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>events and "this" : while elVar is obj(!!!) and we change its props/methods ,
                                then when we pass a callback and inside it we refere to elVar with this . meaning we can
                                prepare callbacks with "this" and pass them to any elVar.method</li>
                            <li>event obj : its an obj that passed to ur in-eventListener-func-paramz , which is
                                contain the obj properties , for each kind of event there is different obj , add a param
                                any name to catch it and use its evt.prop </li>

                                    <li>click : is fired when the whole single click (mouse key down + clicked +
                                        up on the same point + no drag ) , this event can be activated by code with
                                        elVar.click() [thi will not show in intellisense but still work] </li>

                                        of interaction with the key to fire the event , Important evt.porpz <ul>
                                            <li>evt.key : which is the meaning of the key that pressed , meaning
                                                if it capital/small letter it will be different also on other lagz the

                                            <li>evet.code : this is a reference for each physical key on the
                                                keyboard if u press a then evet.key is a and evet.code is KeyA as for
                                                space evet.key is " " and evet.code is Space , both shif have Shift key
                                                but code is ShiftLeft or ShiftRight etc . </li>

                                    <li>one of the form important action is the submission to the action=""
                                        location , after the buttin pressed it take the input info to the
                                        location and then refresh the page , a thing that we dont want on SPA , so the
                                        event func should start with activating preventDefault() method then do what u
                                        want with the info:
                                        <span><code class="language-js">formVar.addEventListener(`submit`,function(e){
                                                e.preventDefault(); do this with the input.value
                                                });</code></span>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>change & input events : those 2 used for general change inside input elm
                                        (not just keypress or click) in case of copy-paste, voice input etc , the
                                        difference is that onChange take effect after making change and leave(unfocus)
                                        the input while onInput firing on every CHANGE that happen inside input element,
                                        if arrows and shift been pressed that doesnt count as change(eg. live view of
                                        other user styping) </li>
                                </ol>

                            <li>prevent events-bubbling : which is triggering an event on elm inside multi-lvl
                                elmz that also have events will trigger them all , to stop that add
                                <i>e.stopPropagation</i> on the lvl where u wana the bubble to stop .
                            </li>
                            <li>events delegation (for l8er created elm): a problem that gonna popup when u use
                                for-of to give same event listener for HTML-collection which is that it will work only
                                on thouse that exist (that was in the collection when the loop execcuted), so
                                instead of assign event to the children we go to the parent and onclick inside the func
                                the work done on e.target (ofc if there is nested lelements u need to make a cond like
                                so: <br>

                        <p> <span class="ST">OOP : </span></p>
                        the idea behind OOP is organising the cod , designing and structure the code so the
                        future usage of objects will be easy , by making a classes, add a prototype + methods +
                        properties to it , so l8er when declare an instance from that class via new it will already
                        inherit the features .
                        <ul>
                            <li>obj prototypes : <br>
                                this is special kind of property which is way to inherit methods(features) in js
                                from a parent template-obj to the children from same type , meaning in js there is a
                                template(class) that contain the built in obj of methods called prototype so
                                when an identifier defined as obj with {} it automatically get a copy from that template
                                with a reference property (__proto__)(double underscore called dunder)different id
                                and name of which u choose . methods can be add to any structure prototype (though
                                missing around with js prototypes it is not recommended) and then the new method is
                                valid locally in the page(file) it can be done by assigning : <br>
                                <code class="language-js">String.prototype.myMythod=function(){alert(`hi`)}</code><br>
                                bcz the names inside the class need there valz from outside u CANT pass func
                                expression as arg to make method inside the new obj , thus they added to prototype
                                section.

                            </li>
                            <li>factory function :(just know the concept ,its not commonly used) its a funct
                                that take argz and save them as inner obj properties then u add couble of methods to the
                                obj then the party start :) ,its just another way that looks more "organized" . </li>
                            <li>constructor and the keyword new : constructor in its basic idea (the old way) is
                                a func (evolved and will be used as class), inside it is a template of what prop and
                                metods to add when it "invoked" INSIDE an obj identifier (obj from ) , to make obj out
                                of it and keep unique reference we useing the keyword new on assign like so : <br>
                                <code class="language-js">function CarPaint(r, g, b) {this.r = r;this.g =
                                    g;this.b = b;}</code><br>
                                <code class="language-js">const myInstance = new CarPaint(255,255,255)</code>
                                <code class="language-js">result myInstance{r:255,g:255,b:255}</code> <br>
                                notes <ol>
                                    <li>why put the methods in constructor and not on the obj ? less messy when
                                        obj is viewed </li>
                                    <li>accepted symantec for constructor/class is to start identifier with
                                        capital letter to be distinguishable from normal funcz/objz </li>
                                    <li>__proto__ now had the ur constructor and the general __proto__ so the
                                        constructorand dont mix with the JS __proto__</li>
                                    <li>proto methods are added separatelly (in on constructor declare) </li>
                                    <li>u cant but already invoked funcs or js methods ,just inside definition
                                        of func otherwise on making instance the get invoked</li>
                                    <li>vs code intellisense dont show __proto__ but its still work (like
                                        myinput.value)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>remember not to use arrow-funcz cuz the problem with this </li>
                                    <li>the main use of this is to make template that we gonna generate from it
                                        values (dont forget the ultimate goal is to get values via applying the new
                                        obj(instanse) method on the instance it self and it return the wanted
                                        value), this way is good when numerous of instances from same features(propz)
                                        are expected for the same kind of processing (different valz) e.g an input
                                        of color/img to be b.g then on every user pick we make new instance from
                                        predefined constructor(class)and use its method to change the div/body bg .
                                    </li>

                            </li>
                            <li>class : is a better way to write a constructor , started with keyword class
                                followed by capital 1st identifier then curly braces {},inside we define a constructor
                                that take the propz as this.name and after it we define the prototype methods as
                                funcName(){};NO FUNCTION keyword , a whole class whould be like : <br>

                                <div class=" d-flex flex-column align-items-center ">
                                    <pre id="pre1">

                                            this.r = r;

                                            return `rgb(${this.r},${this.g},${this.b}) `;

                                type of objz (class to make classes that make objz) with thge syntax : class Dog extends

                                u will find on dogs objs the pet.__proto__ are found in separate __proto__
                                inside the dogObj one, therefore when concating a method it 1st go to the closest

                        as an intro 2 concepts need to be explained about how JS work : <ul>
                            <li>
                                <lab>call stack (concept) :</lab> its the mechanism that js used to keep track of
                                where/what being executed when high order function is executed .so if HOF calls func2
                                that calls func3 1rs they stacked on top of each others then the execution started from
                                func3 to give val to func2 then got deleted func2 give val to HOF and got deleted, then
                                next func on the HOF until we have all the values from all funcs then return our wanted
                                val , meaning 1st the funcs got stacked then the execution start from top to
                                bottom (last in first out LIFO) . <br>
                                (that was in same HOF lvl , on the file lvl its always top to bottom left to
                                right). on same concept the browser debugger works : when breakpoint added and run the
                                code its stop on the point then press step-in and u can see on Call-stack tab the stack
                                of the func u at , and the arrow of execution start automatically from top while u
                                step-in more on local tab u can see the func input val and the return val .
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <lab>single threaded & WebAPIs (concepts) :</lab> JS is single threaded mean that one
                                "thing"/line of code of JS can be undergoing on a given point but not doing things
                                simultaneously.
                                <br> in case there is a func that already known by definition that it can take
                                time js hand it of to the browser to handle tracking of result and continue to the next
                                line , for instance setTimeout if there is func after setTimeout it will be executed b4
                                the time out . <br>
                                <strong><strong>!!! ADVANCE EXPLINATION !!!</strong> </strong><br>
                                JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled one.interpreter
                                converts the JS code to a machine code. There are several types of interpreters
                                (known as engines).The most popular browser engines are V8 (Chrome), Quantum
                                (Firefox) and WebKit(Safari).Incidentally, V8 is also used in apopular non-browser
                                runtime,Node.js.Each engine contains a memory heap, a call stack, an event
                                loop, a callback queue and a WebAPI with HTTP requests, timers, events, etc., all
                                implemented in its own way for faster and safer interpretation of the JS
                                code.<br>
                                single-thread language is one with a single call-stack and a single
                                memory-heap. It means that it runs only one thing at a time. <br>
                                Multithreaded programming is programming multiple, concurrent execution
                                threads. These threads could run on a single processor. Or there could be multiple
                                threads running on multiple processor cores. <br>
                                Sometimes you can deal with a popular error, notified by Maximum call stack
                                size exceeded. It is easy to get this using recursion :
                                <br> <code class="language-js">function foo() {foo()} foo()</code> <br>
                                and our browser or terminal freezes. Each browser, has a different call
                                stack size limit.In the vast majority of cases, they are sufficient and the problem
                                should be looked for elsewhere. <br>
                                Blocked Call Stack: suppose u use Node.js synchronous function readFileSync.
                                any code after it will not be exuted and the read finish.but JS can also be
                                non-blocking and behave as if it were multi-threaded by using Asynchronous Behavior,
                                It means that it doesnt wait for the response of an API call, I/O events, etc., and
                                can continue the code execution. this is possible thanks to the JS engines which
                                use (under the hood) real multi-threading languages, like C++ (Chrome) or Rust
                                (Firefox). They provide us with the Web API under the browser hoods or ex.
                                I/O API under Node.js that can take multiple async and start execute multiple at
                                same time as its real multi-threaded . <br>
                                The question is, how does the runtime know that the call stack is empty and
                                how is the event in the callback queue invoked? meet Event Loop. It is a part of
                                the JS engine. This process constantly checks if the call stack is empty and, if it
                                is, monitors whether there is an event in the callback queue waiting to be
                                invoked. That's all the magic behind the scenes!. next lvl is Multi-threading vs
                                Parallel Programming!

                                executed(and failure) then on the second callback success another callback etc etc like

                            <li><span>promise :</span> is a class that represent the success or failure of asynchronous
                                operation(func) on completion! . the only thing that it does is making the
                                executor temporary leave the code inside the promise instance we made for l8er. this
                                class have resolve and reject methods and we need to name them inside the AF argz to use
                                them l8er. the Af inner funcz executed Immediately when the promise instance is created.
                                the asynchronous thing here is that the return of these funcz can take its time
                                thanks to promise inner methods and propz, inside promise class there is 2 props
                                State and Result : <br>
                                State can be one of 3 valz : pending/fulfilled/rejected when its fulfilled (data
                                recived) or rejected (error recived) but now if we got data/error from url then
                                state!=pending) now the executor come to complete promise inner methods
                                resolve()/reject() then/catch/finally part of the file! to execute our funcs of
                                how to manage/handle the outcomes, if there is no err or val and no
                                setTimeout it will still pending forever. in then-catch we usually include indication
                                text to be displayed in console so we can be sure that this is a success respond in case
                                it looks weird (then we know its server/database problem). <br>
                                <strong>
                                    UNSOLVED : does i need to make cond to determine if its resoleve() or
                                    reject() ? and do i need to spicify resoleve/reject with what ? (its not auto with
                                    what recived? <br>
                                    seems if u use client no need its already automated and when u do some manual
                                    examples yes u need !!!
                                </strong>
                                the result prop is changed with what passed to resoleve()/reject(), resolve() in
                                promise only return(data? auto?) to the 1st .then() which return a hidden
                                promise , reject() pass result only to .chatch() which also return a hidden promise and
                                so there funcz can be async one (its there hidden just in case of more asynchronous
                                funcz!) , in case of chained then note that pre-built async funcs from HTTP clients
                                auto return the result , if u wna do some manual funcs inside one then u have to return
                                the outcome to be auto inserted to next then . <br>
                                so promise do 2 main things : <ol>
                                    <li>delay the executor until we have data returned from the asynchronous
                                        func </li>
                                    <li>handling what ever return with resoleve()/reject() inside promise(to
                                        fill result
                                        and return result out) after that continue with further
                                        handling/re-async with
                                        .then() and.chatch()

                                error handling u need to make condz for every expected different text to be

                                displayed in console by console.log or throwing error which can be done manually(usually
                                with condition) via using throw keyword and new copy of Error class (which is the

                                trigger .we can use 1 catch for them all or we can for each await its own try-catch for
                                more specificity, unlike promise where each 1 have only 1 catch . note that any func
                                that can emit/return an err to after-promise-catch() can also emit/return it to

                                        information interchange format today as a successor after XML, while the
                                        wires/cloud understand only binary (a bit store 0 or 1 byte stor 8 bits
                                        kilobyte 1000 etc) we need to simplify and unify our request format which for
                                        now days is JSON which we need to stringify to string ! because string is just a
                                        series of bytes and byts 8 bits ! and on the other side we need to parser to
                                        revers binary to JSON and then saved to an identifier and push the info into
                                        element then to the DOM. the syntax format is similar to JS obj but there is a
                                        differences to note :
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>its consist of key(name)-valu but the names always in a string-literal
                                                and double quotes is most singles are invalid in JSON

                                            <li>in JASON values can be any type except undefined, null/true/false can be

                                        JSON also used in other languages as they have to connect to some APIs
                                        so they have there own way of parsing JSON to there lang , so when we get
                                        respond we actually get a string that saved to a var then it gonna be parsed to
                                        current prog-lang format(obj?). in JS :
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>convert from obj to JSON string as follows :

                                        <lab>HTTP :</lab> do a request by customizing the URL, (Unlike REST
                                        API),HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the canonical way used on the web for
                                        data communication and for making different types(customized)
                                        requests/connections to servers/APIs. <br>
                                        HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are
                                        two types of messages:requests sent by the client to trigger an action and
                                        responses from the server. <br>
                                        The start-line and HTTP headers of the HTTP message are collectively known as
                                        the head of the requests, whereas the HTTP message payload-body is the
                                        actual information of the data that is sent in the HTTP Message Body
                                        (if any), prior to transfer encoding being applied. If transfer encoding is not
                                        used, the payload body and message body are the same! <br>
                                        msgBody = payload + encoding , msgBody-encoding = payload !!! <br>
                                        this division can be seen in the network tab after selecting a request/response
                                        from the list . <br>
                                        HTTP uses different "verbs"(pre-build in-client funcs) to determine what
                                        kind of connection is intended for this upcoming URL, each URL is targeting a
                                        point of entry into the server which called "endpoint" , endpoint name usually
                                        is a Class name and using it as endpoint gives u access of the instances that
                                        made from it. the server "response status" is numbred as first digit of the
                                        status code specifies one of five standard Classes that describes the result of
                                        the URL(verb) targeting the endpoint : <br>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>1xx informational response - the request was received,
                                                continuing process</li>
                                            <li>2xx successful - the request was successfully received,
                                                understood, and accepted</li>
                                            <li>3xx redirection - further action needs to be taken in order to
                                                complete the request</li>
                                            <li>4xx client error - the request contains bad syntax or cannot be
                                                fulfilled</li>
                                            <li>5xx server error - the server failed to fulfil an apparently
                                                valid request</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        to go specefic about endpoints usually APIs docs includes what variables
                                        (pre-built queries) chained in the URL and the order of them .
                                        different APIs uses different symantecs for there variables like id> :id
                                        {{id}} mean fill the requested id here , or what is more common to use is query
                                        string which manually fillter the endpoint content that gonna be returned
                                        according to the query parameters, its look like '/cases?sort=desc&color=blue'
                                        originnally {sort:'desc',color='blue'} which is key-val pairs and also class
                                        properties that u searching on its instances . it means from the objz that is
                                        copy of cases get hose that there color is blue srort them ascendent (Z-A) .
                                        another use case for ? is to be followed by `q` in case of general search for
                                        value (in any property).<br>
                                        <strong>so it : endpoint followed by variable nad then if necessary (on get) can
                                            be followed by query</strong> <br>
                                        URLs must be accurate to target endpoint ,any typo with
                                        generating-URL/(chaining/appending)-variables will result error, but not
                                        after the query mark bcz u ask the server to look for something and it always
                                        return 200 even if the results are 0 (doesnt count err).<br>
                                        in API testing tools like HOPPSCOTCH or Postman there is an option
                                        instead of adding to the URL ? and the query string u can put the basic URL and
                                        under it u input pairs for the paramZ .

                                        <lab>HeaderS :</lab> they are part of every request/respond its also key-val
                                        pairs and it specify info about the content that gonna be recived in the

                                        what the api docs require for there custom headers custom , in social media and
                                        chat apps headers are used as sorce of basic info to be shown in "link view" ,
                                        some API require devz to send headers along with the requests , more about it on

                                        Here are some of the most common API Headers you will encounter when testing any

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Authorization: Contains the authentication credentials
                                                for HTTP authentication.</li>
                                            <li>WWW-Authenticate: The server may send this as an
                                                initial response if it needs some form of
                                                authentication before responding with the actual resource being
                                                requested. Often following this header is the
                                                response code 401, which means “unauthorized”.</li>
                                            <li>Accept-Charset: This header is set with the request and
                                                tells the server which character sets
                                                (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, Windows-1251, etc.) are acceptable by the

                                                application/javascript, etc.) a response is sent in. This is an
                                                important header field that helps the client
                                                know how to process the response body correctly.</li>

                                                be stored by the client and re-used till the time defined by the
                                                Cache-Control header.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        Usage : headers usually is more part of the server response also they are auto
                                        generated by the HTTP clint like axios, but if there is an API demand to include
                                        headers in the request then : on get request u need to chain them in the link as
                                        any other body varz, in post request there should be a place for headers in
                                        post-func-paramz depend on the HTTP client in use ,(eg on axios.post() its 3rd
                                        param after url and body).

                                        <lab>XHR :</lab> (just for concept and clients evo) : stand for
                                        XML.HTTP.Requests it an old/original practice for AJAX conceptand making
                                        requests , it doesnt
                                        support promise (suquence must be nested) in which u need 1st to new obj from
                                        XMLHttpRequest class and define the properties .onload (whet happen on
                                        success) and .onerroer b4 starting use the request methods(verbs) . an example
                                        gonna looks like the follows :

                                        <lab>Fetch API :</lab> a newer edition to js support promise used in the famous
                                        Axios client (library) behind the scene .
                                        <br>
                                        (MDN definition : The Fetch API allows you to fetch resources across the
                                        network, providing a modern alternative to XHR. It has a number of
                                        advantages, and what is really nice about it is that browsers have recently
                                        added the ability to consume a fetch response as a readable stream.The
                                        Request.body and Response.body properties are available, which are getters
                                        exposing the body contents as a readable stream.) ,
                                        <br>
                                        though it have a drawback/confusing part : its inner promise gonna be marked as
                                        resolved as soon as there is a ready to read chunk from the stream (in our case
                                        the response header) although the stream not closed yet and the data still
                                        coming, for that we have to use on the 1st .then a fetsh method res.json() (this
                                        is not JSON class!!) which by the time it turn comes in the funcs stack the
                                        stream should be closed and the data is complete and it will read the data from
                                        fetch , ofc the data need to be returned for next .then , so in short its always
                                        2 steps with fetch the request and the parsing, note that error response doesnt
                                        need parsing.
                                        <br>
                                        a nice thing of fetch with async still much compact syntax than XHR , u can make
                                        it even nicer by replacing then/catch after exucting the async func with
                                        try-catch that inside the async func making clean exucting with only funcName(),
                                        another note that the actual response with headers and status code found only on
                                        the the 1st then(or 1st identifier in async) and only the data passed to the
                                        second then after being .json() , on post request the body should be JSON format
                                        (JSON.stringify(obj))
                                        <br>
                                        in every response (success or error) the actual data (payload) is found in prop
                                        called data (in error response more deeply nested) , in fetch-post-request only
                                        return data , not the whole response .

                                        <lab>AXIOS :</lab> is a promise based HTTP client/library(not native part JS)
                                        for the browser and node.js need to get flile/npmInstall then includ/import to
                                        ur js(this way we get intellisense?), or add to HTML by cdn/file , check the
                                        install in README on github <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios#installing"
                                            target="_blank">here</a>
                                        after including in the HTML file the axios obj is usable in the JS file or
                                        inside a script tag but it will not auto complete (intellisense)
                                        the basic use of it (for get request) is replacing fetch with axios.get() and no
                                        need for extra step of internal parsing . the headers format is the same and the
                                        body can take obj (no need to stringify . axios is smart about the body content
                                        that u append thus if u didnt include headers of 'Content-Type'it will auto fill
                                        it then if ur content tybe is not the right one the API can reject it bcz of
                                        axios headers . <br>
                                        in axios-get request there is optional param after the url called options which
                                        its value can be automated to be added to the url it should look like : <br>
                                        const options = { params: { id : val , q : val }, headers : {} } ; <br>

                                                Useful to use if your code works with Promises and needs to execute
                                                sequentially. Due to blocking, you might lose some ability to process
                                                code in parallel. I've primarily used async-await when making API
                                                requests. If you develop your frontend with React.js, a typical use case
                                                might be
                                                to display a loading screen until a fetch request returns and then using
                                                a setState to update the UI.

                                                Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. This
                                                information is collected and then exported into a format that is more
                                                useful for the user. Be it a spreadsheet or an API.
