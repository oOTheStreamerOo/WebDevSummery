                <p><span class="ST">Terminal -&gt; Shell(CLI) -&gt; Kernal :</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The terminal is a program in linux that u open to start writing text inputs ,while its just a
                        GUI of colored text and layout to orgnize the text (unlike the old days when unix was
                        plain white text) it need an "engine/interpreter" to be loaded for these lines/commands/scripts
                        to be passed to the OS-Kernal in its own lang (C) and that is the shell which can be simple as
                        set of commands(which tend to be called CLI)or advanced one with a scripting lang (which tend to
                        be called shell) . <br>
                        examples for CLIz is what Frameworks use: Angular-CLI ionic-CLI veu-CLI git-CLI examples for
                        shellz : bash/zch/cmd/powershell...etc CLIz can be installed inside a shell so the commands be
                        included , shell is a computer program that "surround" the kernel (as shell) and exposes the
                        operating-system-services to a human user or other programs in order to use those services and
                        processes. in fact shells are not connected directly to the kernel they rather using the kernel
                        api . <br>
                        If you're running any tools for web development you'll mostly gonna need to pop the command line
                        and run some commands to use your chosen tools (you'll often see such tools referred to as CLI
                        (command line interface) ,most of which are installable from package registries (the cloud base
                        that package managers pull from). Package registries are like app stores, but (mostly) for
                        command line based tools and software.
                        <br>
                        in every OS there is OS-Kernel(Core) that control the hardware. the software run on it , and
                        to access this kernel directly a shell need to be installed (as surround gate) which by using
                        its commands u actually allowed to make changes in the kernel.
                        as parallel to shell in window there is command prompt or the newer v. PowerShell (same names
                        goes for shell and terminal) and in linux most distroz uses bash and terminal,most of servers in
                        the world uses linux cuz its faster an lighter OS , further more bash shell is officially
                        available for windows 10 and higher,thus bash is the way to go . <br>
                        to wrap up with the terminology :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Terminal : is the linux name of the program that you opens in order to choose/load a
                                shell , in windows its cmd or the newer powershell ,its not just didcated program
                                VS-code have terminal in it , it comes with configurations of graphical layouts that
                                shells can choose from to be more nice and organized to read . you might also see
                                terminal-emulator term which is mean that the terminal take the plain text and
                                emulate it into a more graphical layout </li>
                            <li>Shell/CLI : is the engine/lang doing everything inside the terminal inc the look of the
                                command line(prompt) from terminal set of options also the commands and scripts to use
                                to do services that availablein the kernel options .
                                meanwhile CLI they are minmal version that usually have only custom commands and usually
                                used by libraries/frameworks/apps that need to setup an there own
                                environment/sitting/commands and require u to interact with there framework via there
                                command.
                            </li>
                            <li>Kernel : The kernel is the core of any operating system and generally has
                                complete control over everything in the system. It is the part of the operating
                                system code that is always resident in memory until the system shuts down and
                                facilitates interactions between hardware and higher software components. Functions of a
                                kernel nclude scheduling processes, resource allocation, device management, interrupt
                                handling, memory management, and process management. </li>

                            <strong>In the Beginning</strong> "Thompson Shell" was the first Unix shell by Ken Thompson,
                            introduced in the first version of Unix in 1971, It was a simple command interpreter, not
                            designed for scripting, togother with Dennis Ritchie who created the C lang they made the
                            unix at Bell Labs. <br>
                            in 1979 "Bourne shell" was developed by Stephen Bourne , it was a replacement for the
                            Thompson shell, which its executable file had the same extension —sh.<br>
                            in 1989 was the first released of "Bourne Again Shell"(Bash) as Unix shell and command
                            language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software
                            and from here the GNU founded by Richard Stallman continue to maintain and develop bash .
                            FYI bcz unix was developed by AT&T Corp it was close source then Linux os came in
                            1991 as FOSS ,created as a hobby by Linus Torvalds based on the principles and design of
                            Unix.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Why</strong> we need it as web devzzz:
                        <ol>
                            <li>speed: if u know what u doing and with experience its much faster to complete some
                                tasks using a Terminal copmared to GUI applications navigation (finder/explorer) . </li>
                            <li>access: the amount/level of access that available in the terminal is much
                                bigger/deeper than GUI, it gives access to areas/configs which some of available only
                                this way , and these usally not meant for average user to change , so u need to be
                                careful with the changes u do , With great power comes great responsibility (backup?
                                GitHub? system restore?)</li>
                            <li>tools: a lot of technology that we use in the backend such as node(express) and
                                databases they are base around terminal to be functional and run things arround, </li>
                        </ol>
                        <strong>Use Cases :</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A common terminal task is installing application which can be done by a single
                                command, compared to navigating through the Software Centre or Synaptic Manager.</li>
                            <li>bash is also a programming language that allow us to write scripts for the commands

                        <strong>Installing Bash :</strong> <br>
                        bash can be installed in 2 ways :
                        <ol>
                            <li>as part of bash+git on git instalation: the easiest way to setup , gives bash
                                (with git CLI included) without all linux enviroment , Git-Bash come with GNU Core
                                Utilities, includes ls, cat, etc.available beside Unix commands on Windows.
                            </li>
                            <li>Bash on Ubuntu on Windows a.k.a. Windows Subsystem for Linux (<a

                                an entire basic Ubuntu Installation on Windows certified by Microsoft. It just not
                                includes bash, but more cool features of Ubuntu like its package manager, software
                                collection.You can install and use any Ubuntu software. <br>

                                steps to install Windows Subsystem for Linux :
                                <ol>
                                    <li>go to start menu search for windows features</li>
                                    <li>go to windows subsystem for linux, check it and restart</li>
                                    <li>open power shell and run the command "wsl --install" or download "Ubuntu on WSL"
                                        app from microsoft app store <a

                                    </li>
                                    <li>after downloading open it to complete instalation</li>
                                    <li>make username and password </li>
                                    <li>test if it works by cd /mnt/c/users/TheStreamer/desktop then touch test.txt then
                                        edit with nano and read with cat </li>
                                    <li>do update+upgrade for the shell and the other packages that installed with it
                                        (e.g nano editor) on proccess use the passowrd from b4 with these commands :
                                        <br> <i>sudo apt-get update</i> ,then upgrade . update fitch the latest info
                                        abot the packages from them cloud repos and upgrade will download pkgz from
                                        repos with higher version no. (apt = Advanced Package Tool = package /
                                        sudo=super user do : permission to use specific system commands at the root

                                    </li>
                                    <li>the files location to access from explorer is : \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu . also
                                        can be seen in explorer side panel as external dir "Linux" . </li>
                                    <li>lastly go install vs-code extention of wls for better sync from vs-code terminal
                                        with wls</li>

                                u can actually install git CLI in bash with <i>sudo apt install git-all</i> (every
                                modern linux and WSL have git pre-installed , while bash environment wasnt officialy
                                supported in win 10 git made there own offical copy) . <br>
                                after done with installing WSL u can open bash from ubunto app or in CMD-prompt by the
                                typing "bash" ("exit" get u back to cmd ).

                                after finishing with installing WSL it should have latest git version for linux (after
                                upgrade) , future updating git can be done togother along with system by update+upgrade
                                or individually by running "sudo apt-get update" then <i>sudo apt-get install
                                    git</i> and check version with <i>git --version </i> . <br>
                                if u tried to install git via git-window-installer one of the steps is installing bash ,
                                git-bash is custom shell with git commands (its not the full scripting lang?); default
                                home bath is "C:\Users\{{thisUser}}" (as parallel to the user folder in linux). <br>
                                on debian-destro : "sudo apt update" "sudo apt install git" "git --version"

                        <strong>How to Use</strong>/open terminal:
                        <ol>
                            <li>using bash-shell (in prompt) :

                                    <li>in window : simply by search in start menu for ubuntu or bash (git

                                    <li>in vscode : hit the keybind ctrl+` to open small window down in vscode and
                                        choose ur terminal by pressing the arrow-dowm button (right to the plus)</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>using bash scripting inside a project : the file extentions is .sh/without(in linux
                                executable can be without) file always starts with Shebang (octothorp/hashtag with
                                exclamation mark #!) to tell the OS what the interpreter type that gonna be used,after
                                Shebang the full path for the interpreter such as /bin/bash in linux . All scripts under
                                Linux execute
                                using the interpreter specified on a first line. <br>
                                note that bash is case sensitive.

                        <strong>EXTRA</strong> info about bash internal(systimatic) files and work :
                        <ul>** remember that every program rathar than the kernel and the shell is initiated via the
                            shell
                            <li>there is 2 types of shell : <br>
                                ** Interactive and Non-Interactive Shells ** ,A shell has two working modes:
                                An interactive shell reads user input typed on a keyboard. Commands run in the
                                current shell and the system waits for further instructions from the user. A
                                Bash shell considered interactive . in other words it await in the background like a
                                service, still loded in ram until terminate not untill the file executed done. <br>
                                A non-interactive shell also called subshell which initiated to execute commands from a
                                file and exits.
                            </li>
                            besides .sh (projects scripting extention) there is system files for bash (which is big
                            aspect but in short) 2 main scriping files of differant extentions that can be customized ,
                            bashrc and bash_profile:
                            <li>Bashrc is a configuration file for Bash shell,this file is executed each time you open a
                                new terminal, it contains commands that are executed in every kind of shell.Bashrc is
                                used to set environment variables, define aliases, and create functions. It's also used
                                to prompt that appears in your terminal.
                            </li>
                            <li>Bash_profile is also configuration file for Bash shell, but it's executed only once
                                when you log in to your account. its like few more commands that special for each user
                                and they dont take effect in a sission untill a user log-in .
                                This file is used to set the user environment, variables and run commands that are
                                needed only once at start of your session/subshell. Bash_profile is commonly used to set
                                PATH variable, which is variable that determines where shell searches for
                                custom executables.
                            </li>
                            Bashrc is executed each time you open a new terminal window regardless if its on account
                            log-in or not , while bash_profile is executed only once when you log in to your account.
                            This means that any changes you make to bashrc will take effect immediately, while when you
                            log out and log back in again. <br>
                            changes to bash_profile will take effect only Bashrc is commonly used to set aliases, define
                            functions, and customize prompt. Bash_profile s commonly used to set PATH variable and to
                            run commands that are needed only once at start of your session. <br>
                            Suppose you want to set an alias for ls command to list files in long format. You can do
                            this by adding following line to your bashrc file: alias ll='ls -l' this will be available
                            for all terminal windows . <br>
                            Suppose you have installed a custom application in your home directory, and you want to add
                            its location to your PATH variable so that you can run it from anywhere in your shell. You
                            can do this by adding following line to your bash_profile file:
                            export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/myapp/bin .
                        </ul> <br>

                    <li>GIT is the most widely version control system made as FOSS by Linus Torvalds same person that
                        developed linux.this is a system for keep track of changes that happen across a set of files
                        (our sorce-code), any type of source code (is the orginal code that we write,unlike compiled
                        code) can be tracked, basically we save an initial version of our code into git repo and turning
                        on changes tracker and later we save changes on commit(save), also we can make branches so we
                        can work on multiple versions on the app simultaneously(this is usfull in case of team
                        working/try things/add things too larg/trey on currently-in-use code),then we can switch between
                        branches and commits(snapshots),with "checkout" we can look back at all of the changes we have
                        made previous version of the code to check it for clients using that version. note that vscode
                        come with preinstalled source-controll extention that can used as gui to do the jop .

                        meanwhile GITHUB a website owned by microsoft that offer a cloud storage solution for git
                        repositories (aka repo: is a stored copy of the project regardless the storage location/type) ,
                        this is not 100% free and privacy not provided (microsoft can read and use ur code), also its
                        not mandatory to use github with git , it can be other cloud solutions .

                    <p class="ST">Git : </p>
                    <li>git CLI to use in terminal <br>
                        lets start with with how to use git localy: <ol>
                            <li>before start using git run the following command to change the default master(main/dev)
                                branch name to main/dev (or any) bcz its culture sensitive and Github default naming is
                                main : <i>git config --global init.defaultBranch main</i>,and for future the
                                just-created branch can be renamed via this command: <br> <i>git branch -m xyz</i><br>
                                another thing to do b4 start using git u need to assign user name and email , u can
                                check if this done with: <br>
                                <i>git config --list</i> if not use <i>git config --global user.name "xyz"</i> and
                                <i>git config --global user.email "xyz@xyz.com"</i> <br>
                                any email is ok for local perpouses but for future puching to github u may go and make
                                github account then nav to https://github.com/settings/emails and on Primary email
                                address there is a sugestion for noreply email provided in the text , copy it and use it
                                instead of urz.
                            </li>

                            <li><i>git init</i> : to implement git empty repo in a folder cd there in VScode terminal
                                then "git init", notice files and folders name are now green and to the right on git tab
                                there is no. of the files that need to be saved and on the left-bottom corner it says
                                Main, the repo it self is a hidden folder in VScode to reveal it go to settings search
                                for file.Exclude and edit **/.git and delete it and save , now its only empty repo </li>
                            <li><i>git status</i> : to check the current state of the repo what added(tracked) deleted
                                modified etc, the grean files names and the grean U nest to the name mean untracked (not
                                added) , some files needed ignored and not show in status at all like private keys and
                                libraries files (build-files/dependencies), to do that make new file named ".gitignore"
                                (recomended in the root dir but can be anywhere also can be multiple ones) and put in it
                                The pathes of the folders/ or files.ext relative to the location of that .gitignore
                                file (eg node_modules/ logs.js reg/keys/ etc..) , now the file name on vscode explorer
                                will be grayed out and will not show up in git-status </li>
                            <li><i>git add .</i> : used to select which files gonna be staged , means there changes

                                replaced with file.ext or folder/ for 1 file/folder .in vscode the U changed to A fot
                                the staged files , to discard changes and git back to Untracked run <i>git reset .</i>
                                or for 1 file <i>git rm --cached xyz.ext</i> ( more about rolling back in adv section

                            <li><i>git commit -m "whatChng"</i> : save a snapshot (backup point) which include the
                                changes that have been made since the last commit, ther is a shortcut command to do

                            <li><i>git log</i> it displays for each commit in a repository history its Secure Hash
                                Algorithm (SHA) id ,which branch got commit on, author, date, commit message, when u run
                                <i>git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all</i> u will get max deitaled and

                                the git icon on the left brings the source control panel it give a breakdown of all the
                                file changes in the project and whether or not they're staged, if you click on a file it
                                will show you the diff between the previous commit and the new file changes red mean
                                deleted grean mean added and white mean no change ,this is useful to track down the
                                exact line of code that caused code to break , another nice thing is that you can easily
                                stage or unstage files by clicking the plus or minus button and the check button to
                                create a commit, furthermore every command you can possibly run found in the drop down
                                menu another feature is on bottom left corner where it says Master/Main/dev Branch when
                                you click on it in a project with multiple branches it will give you a list of all of
                                them so you can easelly witch between them. <br>
                                gitLens is more useful for large projects with multiple people because it adds
                                additional annotations to your code like who is responsible for writing the code
                                along with a bunch of ways to visualize your repo.

                            <li>1st go to github site , make account , then new repo and important dont write any
                                description cuz it will be saved as README file and even deleting it will make
                                differance between local and remote repo !! note that the repo name is after
                                ur account name separated by "/" as if it path , u can add files created on ur local
                                machine or add them on githube vs-code editor online. <br>
                                README file describe what the project is about what it does and relevant info . the
                                extention md as for Markdown is a plain-text file format. GitHub will show its content
                                on the home page of your repo as intro . if u edit this markdown file u can use some
                                shortcuts (markup?) like # for main header ## for subheader. and next to edit there is a
                                preview to see how it gonna look, when edited and wna commit a popup window gonna ask
                                for Commit Message and if the changes gonna added to main branch or creat new one,last
                                commit-msg will be showen next to the file name in the repo listing .all msgz can be
                                viewed by going to the file and hit history, in commit history when u click on one grean
                                with + on the line tart mean added red with - mean deleted and white mean its the same.

                            <li><i>git remote -v</i> :v for verbose(detailed), this show u what remote repos are linked
                                to ur local project , to link the local project to remote repo run this command
                                <i>git remote add origin http://xyz</i> after git-remote-add the 1st argument is
                                alias that we need to assign to the link of the remote repo that we push to so l8er we
                                write shorter commands , same idea with the argument upstream that we assign to the
                                fetch repo that we update from whats it really do though is initial reference(pointer)
                                to github tree(of branches) will start as origin(link)/main/.. while on local tree
                                starts with main/.. ,the files that attached to this are the initial files that we gonna
                                save changes from them on and they are important for ,verifing when we copy files to
                                differant machine we will verify that new local/main iles and origin/main files are
                                pointing to the same commit (thats why origin/main called remote-tracking branch),
                                <i>git remote -v</i> also show the push and fetch links (the origin & upstream) that the
                                same as we set b4 , or use <i>git remote show origin</i> for even more detailed
                                (branches&configs).
                                the url http://xyz is url on the repo page in github+ .git or it can be copied at the
                                same page in the code button (the grean one not the tab) .
                            </li>
                            <li><i>git push</i> : after u used
                                <br><i style="font-size: 1.7vw;">git commit -am "whatChng"</i>
                                its time to upload the code from the local repo to the remote repo with this command
                                <br><i style="font-size: 1.7vw;"> git push origin main -u</i>
                                takes 2 arguments: remote-repo-name and branch, the 3rd is optional flag means upstream
                                (upstream in git cli set the branch as the one fetch when u work on ur repos or set the
                                repo to fech from when u u link ur local repo to other dev repo from github) so when we
                                pull in the future we can just use git pull without additional arguments,by executing
                                this command the whole local repo will be synced to the remote one meaning the files
                                will be updated inc the .git folder which include the tree of changes ,on 1st push be
                                aware that u need a fresh remote repo with no history of changes or files that differant
                                form ur local in this case to overwrite the remote repo u can use
                                <i>git push --force</i> , also that u have used the github noreplay email or unchecked
                                "Keep my email addresses private" on the sittings. from now on any changes on the local
                                files do stgCmt line then push line , but if the opposite happened (u changed on remote)
                                u will need the next command .
                            </li>
                            <li><i>git fetch/merge/pull/rebase</i> when the remote repo is one commit
                                ahead and the files looks differant from the local there is 3 ways to to sync with the
                                local (using fetch then merge using pull using fetch then rebase) : <ol>
                                    <li> fetch&merge: what fetch do is downloading the whole content (files and logs) to
                                        be ready for u to choose what to take from them, merge take only the current
                                        files that downlaoded and merge them with the local but not the logs history,
                                        all the commits on a remote/other branch are combined into a single commit on
                                        the master branch (which making tracking a bug harder cuz the feature commit
                                        history is not included in the merge). <i>git fetch</i>(now if u click main
                                        on left-bottom corner the list that drop have 2 branches) if the command
                                        fetch used without argument (repo elias and branch) means that the upstream
                                        branch (-u) has been selected b4, then <i>git merge origin/main</i> . both fetch
                                        and merge must run from the repo/branch that in short with changes and in the
                                        command the argument is the repo with more changes, the other way around is
                                        using push ! . after execution it say fast-forward which is the simplest merge
                                        strategy when the commits easelly fit one after another so the pointer can move
                                        forward to the most recent commit without conflicts , conflict and solutions
                                        will be explained l8er. ofc when merging 2 branches locally u dont need to fetch
                                        1st .
                                    </li>
                                    <li><i>git pull</i> : it do the fetch and merge in single go by using
                                        <i>git pull origin main</i> if u didnt set a branch as upstream , but since we
                                        used the -u flag earlier for origin/main git pull automaically look for upstream
                                        branch so we dont need to specify the remote fetch branch and u good with only
                                        <i>git pull</i> . however u need always to commit ur changes on local repo
                                        otherwise the operation will fail . but on the other hand u may want to do this
                                        deliberately to reset any changes that happened on local and pull the remote
                                        repo with its changes for that : <br>
                                        <i>
                                            git fetch --all <br>
                                            git reset --hard origin/main <br>
                                            git pull
                                        </i>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><i>git rebase</i> : this command can be used in 2 ways (major uses): <ul>
                                            <li>rebase lets users integrate changes from one branch to another where all
                                                of the current changes and the commit log get merged ,this is an
                                                overcome for merge disadvantage that onlt the current changes moved
                                                wwith 1 commit for doing the merge, git rebase takes all the changes,
                                                and moves the completed work from one branch to another, typically the
                                                main branch. In the process, rebase flattens the history and removing
                                                unwanted entries , unlike git merge that only changes the target head
                                                and creates a one commit for merging, the most common use case for
                                                rebase is to update team member branch (local files) from remote files
                                                by fetching then rebase (so u dont rebase the original work to ur
                                                branch!!) or if u rebase when the upstream branch and ur branch found on
                                                the same machine then u need to make new branch as copy from main then
                                                repase ur branch from it but never the local main !! otherwise u and ur
                                                team will work on completly different commits log which will make
                                                conflicts on later merge or , the general approuch :
                                                <i>git remote add upstream https://orignalRepoLink</i> <br>
                                                <i>git fetch upstream</i> then <i>git rebase upstream/main</i>

                                            <li>rebase have flags to manage and edit the commits THAT HAVE NOT BEEN
                                                PUSHED TO UPSTREAM YET !!!, u edit if they are local or on local and
                                                origin (in this case u can force rewrite orgin ) like change the order
                                                and fix commits msgz and more ,as tart load the interactive list <br>

                                                running the interactive command it will open

                                                line there is the action keyword (default is pick) followed by the

                                                        to take multiple commits and combine them into one single commit
                                                        with a single message, to do that go ahead and run

                                        from the list up . u can create and checkout branch in single command with
                                        <i>git checkout -b xyz</i> , u can get back to main without write its name as so

                                , after commit a conflict can be bcz there is a differant try on the same line number
                                in vs-code u will see the file with the conflict with red color meanwhile on the file
                                the head (local latest) line and the incoming line from branch will be highlighted also
                                can be viewed in the command line with <i>git diff</i> which case ur options is to
                                manually keep one and delete/change the line at the other or put the new code after the
                                old code (the team code after the main code) . these also cn be done via vs-code gui
                                that pop above the line of conflict but beside viewing the diff , usually manual fix is
                                the best but it also can be fixed with cli via prefering the cecurent(ours) :
                                <i>git merge -s ours branch1 branch2 branchN</i> or the incoming(theirs):

                                after choosing how to merge u need to add and commit. else if u decide to stop the merge
                                and role back original state use <i>git merge --abort</i>

                                this will copy the repo to ur own account then clone it to ur machine and make changes
                                without affecting the original repo but its still linked to the original repo so when u
                                do changes and push to ur account (origin) u can ask the author to pull the changes to
                                his repo (ur upstream) from ur repo when u go to ur repo u will see the changes and a

                                to follow them and have a discustion in the issues b4 hitting the pull request , after
                                the author review and accept ur code, while u work with the fork locally u can keep in
                                sync with the original by making the author-repo-link ur upstream repo (and not ur copy
                                on ur account), run the following commands to do so :
                                <i>git remote add upstream https://orignalRepoLink</i> then when there is and update to

                        <ol>
                            <li>advanced <i>git reset</i> : there is few different techniques for dealing with screw-ups
                                when your project state not ideal, git provides couple of tools to role back to an
                                acceptable state , its important to understand the three different file areas of a Git
                                so u know where u to role back (and what command to use): current working files ,
                                staging area (which is cached files) and commit history which is a saved changes state
                                (in files) that you committed previously now fixing things in git often means deleting
                                files !so u need to understand what the right kind of files u wna fix .
                                so staged files (after git add .) can be removed with <i>git reset</i> , if the files
                                had been commited then u need the id or sha for that commit via <i>git log</i> copy the
                                id then run <i>get reset idXYZ</i> note that this keep the staged files (the cached) and
                                roll back the local files , to delete the commit and the staged files in one go
                                <i>get reset heard idXYZ</i>
                                so if there is new file made between the 2 commits (not modified) it will be completly
                                deleted,so carfull with this , also when u work with team u never do a reset been pushed
                                to a remote repo on github cuz if others already have it in there commit tree it will be
                                hard to make up this differance, which where the next command come handy .
                            </li>
                            <li><i>git revert idXYZ </i>this roll back the changes but keep the commit in the tree ,
                                after this u need to commit again and it auto include after ur msg that "this reverts
                                commit idXYZ" </li>
                            <li><i>git commit --amend </i> if u want to make few changes and add them to tatest commit
                                with /without editing the last commit msg then this is it ! after the last commit do
                                what ever you want and in the end run <i>git commit --amend --no-edit</i> or
                                <i>git commit --amend -m "newmsg"</i> and changes just added to last commit . this is
                                better option than "reset hard" (delete commit and staged) or "revert"(delete changes in
                                the last and add new commit) it allows to fix small things on local and add this to the
                                last commit .
                            </li>
                            <li><i>git stash</i>is away to sve some code aside for later recall on the same lines , its
                                like leaving the lines empty for this code to recall it later to try how it impact the
                                rest of the code thet came after it ,be aware that this take all the code that have not
                                commited yet so all the code before this snippet should be comitted, u can save multi
                                stashes and give name for each , if u have just one snippet u can use <i>git stash</i>
                                and recall it with <i>git stash pop</i> , if u use multiple stahes save each with
                                <i>git stash save xyz</i>(xyz a name to recognize) then when u need to use it back u
                                need see what ts number in the list and call the number :
                                <i>git stash list</i> <i>git stash apply #</i> , keep in mind the lines so u dont run
                                into conflict.
                            </li>

                                    <li><i>git commit -am "whatChng"</i> is shorter way to do git add then git commit

                                    <li><i>git commit --amend -m "myMgs"</i> is a fatser way to add things to latest
                                        commit (1st do changes thin run this) ifno change in msg then put --no-edit ,
                                        this is faster than reseting and make new commit this is only work if u havnt
                                        pushed ur work to remot repo then :</li>
                                    <li><i>git puch origin main --force</i> : this will overwrite the remote commit
                                        (that been edited) with the state of ur local code , BE AWARE if there is a
                                        commits on the remote branch (from ur team) that u dont have they will be lost
                                        !!! </li>
                                    <li><i>git revert cmtID</i> if u pushed changes to remote repo that dont need to be
                                        there this remove the changes of that commet , but the commit stay in the
                                        history log and a new commit for reverting need to be added then pushed to the
                                        repo</li>
                                    <li>github remote work : in case u dont have ur pc u can login to ur account on
                                        github from anywherego to ur repo and hit period(.) on ur keyboard to open
                                        vs-code in the browser and write code from there except the terminal which is
                                        paied</li>
                                    <li><i>git stash</i> save a code that u though it MIGHT be good here , do this after
                                        commiting everything b4 it (to isolate it) then <i>git stash save xyz</i> and
                                        when u wna put it back to same linse look for its title xyz in ur stash list
                                        <i>git stash list </i> then apply with its number <i>git stash apply #</i>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><i>git branch -M main</i> to rename master branchto any </li>
                                    <li>git log output can be harder to read as the project get more complex then
                                        use <i>git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all</i> for max deitaled and
                                        decorated view</li>
                                    <li><i>git bisect</i> commandz allow u to trace a bug and find in which commit in
                                        this branch it started, typically the last commit is a bad one so dont need to
                                        put commit id in the command cuz u r on it , sowe run <i>git bisect start</i>
                                        then <i>git bisect bad</i> the next to do is to provide a commit id from log
                                        that is good for sure with <i>git bisect good xyz</i> after this bisect will
                                        start showing you (check out) on ur text editor the file/s from the commit that
                                        in the middle between the good and bad and u need deside if its good/bad with
                                        <i>git bisect good/bad</i> without commit id cuz u on it (the commit checked)
                                        also its brovide how much steps (checkes) remains this is good important
                                        techninal reason : of u dont use gui like kraken no other way (that i know of)
                                        can load past commits in the editor (u can look for what changes happened back
                                        then bit not load the files with that state and run/execute them for testing)
                                        so basically it can be that know from the beginning what is wrong in the code
                                        and u just wna know wehere it started , or u dont know what exactly what is
                                        wrong in the code then u need to run/visual-load/execute the files to know if
                                        the bug is also found in this commit or not. on any way u choose when u find the
                                        1st commit with the bug u need to look what changes have been made then , so
                                        when u on that commit use <i>git diff</i> and after finding the bad lines
                                    </li>

                        using git to manage files between local machine and github : <ol>
                            <li>open the main folder of the projectS with vs-code (we gonna download a folder with the
                                repo name)</li>
                            <li>open termenal of vs-code with ctrl+` (to set default shell open command palette
                                ctrl+shift+p search for " Terminal: Select Default Profile " then chose WSL) </li>
                            <li>it auto set the dir for the folder u opened , check that !</li>
                            <li>go to ur project repo on on github -&gt;Code tab -&gt;Code dropdown button , and copy
                                the HTTPS link or if u made SSH (secure shell protocol) key . </li>
                            <li>run the command <i>git clone {{the project link/key}}</i> now files should be downloaded
                            </li>
                            <li>cd into the downloaded file , hit "ls -la" and u will see file ".git" which is all
                                commit history of this repo inc the ones on github </li>
                            <li>now make changes in ur local files when u start stop writing note next to cursor a
                                faded note of "uncommited changes and if u installed git extention you will git a
                                notification badges . u can 1st check what is not commited yet by <i>git status</i>
                                which show which files have a changes but not commited yet or new files that not still
                                untracked</li>
                            <li><i>git add {{file.ex/folder in this dir}}/"." </i>to make tracked for 1
                                file/folder/all-in-dir"." , after that check again with "git status" now all should be
                                grean(tracked by .git on local). </li>
                            <li><i>git commit -m "myMSG" -m "myDiscription"</i> commit most be with msg of what/why u
                                commit, now changes saved to .git on local </li>
                            <li><i>git push</i> upload the changes to the repo on the remote host (github) it will ask u
                                for username and passowrd but authorization via password has stopped in favor for more
                                secure ways : ssh-token(key)[recomended by community more secure] or https[simple and
                                was recomended by GitHub until its stopped] countinue about push after finish with auth
                                step(11) , a flags to be added to push is <i>git push origin main</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>github authentication on command line access can be donein two ways, HTTPS and SSH :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>SSH Key : Secure Socket Shell are a pair of public and private keys
                                        that are used to authenticate and establish an encrypted communication
                                        channel between a client and a remote machine over the internet. while it use
                                        client/server model to berform the "handshake"(auth) u need to generate a
                                        private and public keys via the shell the private will stay on the machine in a
                                        file that the shell make for it and it will use it for further auth (need to
                                        know the path), the public one will be given to otherz to be able to make auth.
                                        <br> to do that follow these steps : go to ur bash/zsh terminal type
                                        <i>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@g.com"</i> after it generated it ask
                                        where to save it and what name for the file hit Enter for default(recomended)
                                        which is "/home/{{thisUser}}/.ssh/id_rsa" or type full path ends with file name
                                        or type the file name alone and it will keep the default path, then it prompt
                                        for overwrite previous key yes(recomended), then prompt for secure passphrase
                                        like password . now copy the public key with the command from WLS
                                        <i>clip.exe &gt; /home/streamer/.ssh/id_rsa.pub </i> or from any bash enviroment
                                        print to terminal with <i>cat &gt; /home/{{thisUser}}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</i> then
                                        copy it by only highlight it or highlight+rightClick, now go to github -&gt;
                                        sittings -&gt; SSH and GPG keys -&gt; new SSH key , on title add the
                                        name/discription of the machine then paste the key down below its should start
                                        with ssh-rsa then cryptic then ur mail.after making this file backup it and make
                                        system restore point is recommended . now what remain is to add ur private SSH
                                        key to ssh-agent o it can be automaically used by local git by running these 2
                                        commands : <br>
                                        <i>eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"</i> then <i>ssh-add /home/{{thisUser}}/.ssh/id_rsa</i>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>HTTPS :not used anymore for push (it was by only push to same repo url also
                                        need to write ur username and password everytime), its the defult for pull the
                                        only advantages HTTPS has are network related i.e. the handshakes can be
                                        slightly faster, and because it's more ubiquitous (used in browsers), less
                                        likely to have issues with firewalls / NAT.
